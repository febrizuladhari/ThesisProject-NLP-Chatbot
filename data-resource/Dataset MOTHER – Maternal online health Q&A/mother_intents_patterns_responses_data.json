While food is the best source of nutrients, it can be difficult to meet the required intake for these nutrients through diet alone. Therefore, it is recommended to take a prenatal multivitamin that includes 0.4 mg of folic acid and 16 to 20 mg of iron. It is suggested to begin taking the multivitamin two to three months before pregnancy and continue throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Some women\u2019s needs may vary, so consulting a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations is essential."

It's normal for your baby to nurse frequently during this time, as she adjusts to feeding outside the womb. This early breastfeeding period is crucial for establishing milk production and bonding with your baby.

Remember, newborns have very small stomachs and only need a small amount of milk at the start. Being close to your baby or having skin-to-skin contact before expressing milk can help increase production. If breastfeeding wasn\u2019t part of your initial plan, it\u2019s not too late to try and begin. Additionally, extra minerals or calories can be added to your milk if necessary for your baby's needs."

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you may not know the cause. In those moments, staying calm and comforting your baby teaches them to trust you.

Additionally, when the father holds the baby for the first time, the baby will also recognize the father's scent, promoting early bonding. Skin-to-skin contact between father and child in the first hours after birth enhances this connection."
