"580";"382";"Labor usually begins spontaneously between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy, and while the expected delivery date is a guideline, it's not a strict deadline. If labor doesn't begin by 41 weeks, your doctor or midwife may suggest tests to determine if induction is necessary. The mucus plug, which may be lost in stages and sometimes tinged with blood, doesn’t always signal that labor has started.

"581";"383";"Contractions mark the start of labor for most women. During contractions, the belly tightens, and pain is experienced, typically lasting at least 20 seconds. The pain can vary, with some women feeling it in the lower abdomen and others in the lower back, sometimes radiating to the front. Some describe contractions as similar to menstrual cramps but more intense. Each woman's experience with contractions is unique, and the sensations can differ from one pregnancy to another. As labor progresses, contractions become more regular and increasingly intense.";"2024-11-29 11:47:42";"2024-11-29 11:47:42"
"582";"384";"The breaking of the waters, or rupture of the amniotic membrane, can signal the beginning of labor for some women. The amniotic sac holds fluid around your baby, and when it ruptures, the amniotic fluid leaks out, which may appear clear or slightly tinged with blood. The amount of fluid can vary, ranging from a few drops to enough to wet your clothes or even drip onto the floor. Labor usually starts within hours after the water breaks, but if contractions don’t begin or if you are a carrier of group B streptococcus (GBS), labor might need to be induced. Regardless of whether contractions have started, you should go to the hospital or birthing center, where staff will check on both your baby’s well-being and confirm whether your water has actually broken or if it’s just vaginal discharge.";"2024-11-29 11:49:44";"2024-11-29 11:49:44"

"596";"398";"During active labor, contractions become more painful, closer together, and longer, signaling that the cervix has thinned and dilated to about 3 to 5 centimeters. The contractions gradually increase in intensity as the cervix opens to 10 cm. The most painful contractions occur just before complete dilation. The second stage, known as descent, can feel intense and emotional, often compared to a storm. You may experience strong emotions, feel the urge to make noise, or lose control, which is normal.

It’s important to ask the hospital if they offer rooming-in options, although space may be limited. Even if the baby is in an incubator, parents can still encourage breastfeeding and milk production by stimulating their breasts early on. Parents should ask for help with holding their baby or engaging in skin-to-skin contact if possible. If holding the baby is not an option, placing something with the parent's scent near the baby, such as a scarf or piece of clothing, can provide comfort.";"2024-11-29 13:58:02";"2024-11-29 13:58:02"

Hospitals, especially in intensive care wards, usually have breast pumps available and can assist you with expressing milk. Don’t worry if only a few drops come out at first—regular stimulation is key to increasing milk production. Remember, newborns have very small stomachs and only need a small amount of milk at the start. Being close to your baby or having skin-to-skin contact before expressing milk can help increase production. If breastfeeding wasn’t part of your initial plan, it’s not too late to try and begin. Additionally, extra minerals or calories can be added to your milk if necessary for your baby's needs.";"2024-11-29 13:58:56";"2024-11-29 13:58:56"

It's also important to address any concerns your other children may have. They might feel worried or guilty about the baby's health, and it can be helpful to reassure them that the situation is not their fault. Slightly older siblings may also feel jealous, thinking their feelings caused the complications. To support them, try to involve them in caring for the baby when possible, as this can help them feel included and reduce negative emotions.";"2024-11-29 14:00:01";"2024-11-29 14:00:01"

While it is rare for a baby to die before birth or in the first few days of life, the causes are typically related to extreme prematurity or birth defects. In the event of a stillbirth, medical professionals often recommend a natural or induced vaginal delivery. This can be especially difficult for the mother, as her body may begin producing milk or experience bleeding after delivery, which can serve as painful reminders of the loss.

It's helpful to have someone you trust who can take over for a while, allowing you to rest and regain calm. If no one is available, place your baby in a safe space like her crib, step away for a few minutes, and check on her every ten minutes to ensure her safety. Don’t pick her up until you’ve calmed down. Don’t hesitate to seek help from a babysitter, relative, or doctor if needed.";"2024-11-29 15:03:51";"2024-11-29 15:03:51"
"680";"482";"A breath-holding spell is when a baby cries until they stop breathing for several seconds and briefly lose consciousness, often turning blue or pale. This typically occurs around 6 months of age and is usually harmless. If this happens, remain calm, stay with your baby, and reassure her as she will start breathing again on her own. However, if the spell occurs before 6 months of age or lasts longer than one minute, it’s important to consult a doctor.";"2024-11-29 15:04:52";"2024-11-29 15:04:52"
"681";"483";"Newborns naturally have the reflex to suck, with breastfeeding being the most satisfying option. While not all babies need a pacifier, some may use one for comfort, but it shouldn't be in their mouth all the time. If your baby sucks her thumb or fingers, consider offering a pacifier, as it's easier to control. Prolonged use of a pacifier can affect your child's teeth and pronunciation, so it's best to help them gradually stop around the age of 2 or 3, before adult teeth come in. Avoid using pacifiers to calm your baby too quickly, as it may mask her needs.";"2024-11-29 15:05:56";"2024-11-29 15:05:56"
"682";"484";"When choosing a pacifier for your baby, ensure it is appropriate for her age. Opt for either silicone or latex models. If your baby starts using the pacifier for chewing, it's better to offer a teething ring instead. Always ensure the pacifier's disk remains outside her mouth, as chewing on it could cause it to break, posing a choking hazard.";"2024-11-29 15:07:09";"2024-11-29 15:07:09"
"683";"485";"To clean your baby's pacifier, disinfect it according to the manufacturer's instructions before first use, and wash it in hot, soapy water every time your baby uses it. Avoid putting it in your mouth to prevent transferring cavity-causing bacteria. Always check the nipple for flexibility and ensure the disk is securely attached. If the nipple becomes discolored, sticky, cracked, or changes shape, dispose of it immediately to maintain safety.";"2024-11-29 15:08:36";"2024-11-29 15:08:36"
"684";"486";"Touch is a vital form of communication for newborns, providing comfort and reassurance, and helping them feel loved. Holding your baby close, rocking, and caressing her can calm her and foster a sense of security. Massaging your baby is a great way to bond and promote her physical and emotional well-being. Start by massaging her temples or soles of the feet, using gentle motions that she enjoys. Incorporating a massage during bath time with cream or lotion can enhance the experience and encourage relaxation. Baby massage also supports healthy growth and development.";"2024-11-29 15:10:12";"2024-11-29 15:10:12"
"685";"487";"To give your baby a soothing massage, first choose a time when she is awake and receptive, but not too close to feeding. Ensure the room is warm and comfortable, and sit on the floor for ease of access. Use a firm yet gentle touch with your whole hand to avoid tickling, and apply a small amount of warmed vegetable oil, such as sunflower oil, after testing it on a small part of her skin to check for any allergic reactions. Stay relaxed and attentive, observing your baby’s responses to find what she enjoys most. This approach will help create a calming and bonding experience.";"2024-11-29 15:11:08";"2024-11-29 15:11:08"
"686";"488";"Newborns have a developed sense of taste and smell from an early age. They can recognize their mother by her scent, which helps them find the nipple for feeding, providing comfort and satisfaction. The taste of breast milk can change based on the mother's diet. Additionally, when the father holds the baby for the first time, the baby will also recognize the father's scent, promoting early bonding. Skin-to-skin contact between father and child in the first hours after birth enhances this connection.";"2024-11-29 15:11:57";"2024-11-29 15:11:57"
"687";"489";"Newborns can hear from birth and are especially sensitive to their mother and father's voices, as they are familiar with these sounds from the womb. Familiar voices often calm the baby, while loud or sudden noises can startle and upset her. Most babies in Québec have normal hearing, but around six in 1,000 may experience hearing issues. Parents can observe if their baby responds to sounds, like a dog barking or a doorbell ringing, typically by 6 to 9 months. If there's no reaction, it's advisable to consult a doctor for further evaluation. Newborns may also have ears that stick out, but this usually resolves over time.";"2024-11-29 15:12:52";"2024-11-29 15:12:52"
"688";"490";"At 1 month, a baby can see and respond to light that isn't too bright. By 2 months, she can distinguish colors and follow slow-moving objects or people with her eyes. Around 1 year, her field of vision expands to match that of an adult.

"689";"491";"Newborns should always sleep on their back. Once they can turn over on their own, they can sleep in their preferred position without risk. The sleeping environment should include a firm mattress in a crib, cradle, or bassinet that meets Canadian safety standards.

If your baby needs covering, use a light blanket or a sleep sack designed for safe sleep.";"2024-11-29 15:15:26";"2024-11-29 15:15:26"
"690";"492";"It’s not recommended to sleep with your baby, especially on couches or furniture like upholstered chairs, or if you’ve been drinking, taking medication that makes you drowsy, or are extremely tired. In these situations, it’s safer for your baby to sleep in her crib in your room. To safely share your bed, always place your baby on her back, use a firm mattress, remove soft bedding, and ensure there is enough space between the mattress and wall to prevent the baby from getting stuck. Never let your baby sleep alone in an adult bed.";"2024-11-29 15:21:23";"2024-11-29 15:21:23"
"691";"493";"When away from home, always ensure your baby sleeps in a safe place. Never put your baby to bed alone in an adult bed or use pillows. If you don't have a crib, a blanket on the floor can be a temporary safe bed for babies under 6 months. A mattress on the floor or a playpen are other options, but avoid adding extra mattresses or padding to a playpen. A car seat or baby carrier is not a safe place for sleeping, especially if you are lying down while wearing the carrier. For walks, place your baby on her back in a stroller with a flat or almost flat backrest, ensuring she is properly strapped in. Baby carriers are also an option for walks but are not suitable for sleeping.";"2024-11-29 15:24:04";"2024-11-29 15:24:04"
"692";"494";"The main risk factors for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) include exposure to maternal tobacco use or secondhand smoke, sleeping on the stomach, and blankets or bedding that could cover a baby’s face. To reduce the risk of SIDS, ensure your baby sleeps safely, avoid smoking during pregnancy and around the baby, and always put your baby to sleep on her back. Babies who are breastfed and properly vaccinated have a lower risk of SIDS. Additionally, make sure your baby is dressed appropriately for sleep, neither too warm nor too cold. Using a baby monitor does not replace these essential safety precautions.";"2024-11-29 15:25:42";"2024-11-29 15:25:42"
"693";"495";"Flat head syndrome, or positional plagiocephaly, can occur if a baby remains in the same position, such as in a crib or car seat, for long periods. To prevent this, it’s important to vary the baby's position while awake, as the bones of their skull are still soft and can flatten with pressure. A slight flattening usually disappears on its own, while more pronounced flatness may become permanent, though it won't affect the baby’s brain or development.";"2024-11-29 15:27:06";"2024-11-29 15:27:06"

There’s no one right way to do it, but sticking to a routine can make bedtime easier. You can choose to rock your baby to sleep or allow her to fall asleep on her own. The key is to feel comfortable with the routine, and once your baby learns to fall asleep on her own, she will be able to self-soothe if she wakes up during the night.";"2024-11-29 15:33:35";"2024-11-29 15:33:35"

To help her learn to go to sleep on her own, you should teach her to fall asleep independently at bedtime by gradually decreasing the amount of time you stay with her each night. If your baby cries frequently at night, check for health issues like fever, and if it's a recurring concern, consult your doctor.
